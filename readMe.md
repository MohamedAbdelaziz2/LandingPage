INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a dynamic landing page (Udacity project)
i add a new section and a nav bar using html/css
connected the nav bar with the sections using scroll to
how i made sections active on nav bar when scrolled to in the view port i made a
function takes the section and get its coordinates on the page and then check if it's in the view port or not by returning true or false to the view result variable
then i made an event listner on the scroll
This event listner is a (scroll type) listner to any scroll on the page and intiates it self at every point 
It preforms the function on every point you scroll down the page 
The function checks for all the sections if they are in the view port by the help of another function
and if the section in the view port then the section in the nav bar color changes to orange (acive) and all other section to the samge color of nav bar
